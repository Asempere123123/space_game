# Space Game
This is a technical demo I made that has the following characteristics:
- Realistic orbit simulation using Keplerian and Newtonian mechanics
- Procedural true-scale planet rendering using recursively tessellated faces and shaders
- [Functional web version](https://space-game.asempere.net/)

## Controls
- Top-left arrow controls adjust the simulation speed (time warp)
- Scroll to zoom in and out
- Hold right-click and drag to pan the camera
- Press "I" to switch the view to Earth, which is the only planet rendered at realistic scale
- Press "T" to switch to free camera mode (WASD controls)
- Press "O" in free camera mode to double the speed, and "P" to halve it
- Press "O" in free camera mode to double the speed, and "P" to halve it

## Web version
I managed to get a working web version after optimizing some parts of the code. It still requires a good computer to run, and performance will likely be poor if your computer has no GPU.
